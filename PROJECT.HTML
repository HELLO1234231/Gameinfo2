        <h1> GAME REVIEW </h1>

        <p>
          <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/mine.html">
            Minecraft
           </a> is a very good game you can play with your friends and family.
           It is a good game to kill time. You can build whatever you want whenever you want. 
           It is a game about survival you can get resources and food. You can get diamond, iron, gold etc.
           It is your block world your choice. You can buy skins and mods and you can make your own skins.
           You can join servers and play bed wars, cake wars and sky block. But be careful there are 
           skeletons Zombies spiders you name it they will be on the hunt and there are bosses to fight to 
           complete this game.Whilst playing this game I experienced a lot I killed a boss known as the wither
           rarely anyone unlock this achievement killing it is super hard even if you have the best gear,
           it is very rare you defeat that boss including the ender dragon.

           Overall, this game gets a SOLID 9/10.

            Fortnite
           </a>is a very interesting game believe it or not it has a timeline.
           You can play with your friends and family. It is a Player vs player game in each match there is 
           100 players at max. You can also play duos this game mode is normal, but you are in teams of 
           two you can also choose if you want to play solo in duos. Squads is a game mode where 
           there are teams of four instead and you can also play solo in that game mode, but it will
           be quite hard to survive as this time you will be fighting four people if you encounter a squad.
           There is also creative mode where you can play games made by the Fortnite community.
           Every now and then Fortnite adds special limited game modes which is fun to play in. 
           You can buy skins and buy a battle Pass.There once was a game mode that came in Halloween that had 
           zombies and a boss known as Storm king. If you are lucky enough you can join live 
           events which mostly are very cool.
           
           Overall, this game gets a SOLID 8/10.

        <h2> ROBLOX </h2>
        <p>
            Roblox is a free to play game where you can play many other games and make games 
            in this game, I guess. Like I said there are many games to play.Let me tell me my 
            favourite games, first we have piggy if you have ever played granny, it is quite
            similar but this time it is a pig chasing you and it can be multi player. Number 2 
            we have natural disasters this game is where a series of disasters will occur, and you must
            survive till the end. Number 3 we have jailbreak this game is fun you basically can break 
            out of prison drive cars and do more things. You can make skins like mine craft and then 
            wear them or buy skins.
           
            Overall, I give it a SOLID 7/10.

        <h2><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/mk.html">Mortal Kombat</a> </h2>
        <p>
            This is a Two player game if you have 2 controllers you can play with your friends and 
            siblings. You have lots of characters to use. One of my favourites is Scorpion he basically 
            represents fire and the person who I think is his completely opposite his name is 
            Sub-zero he uses ice he is another of my favourite characters another character called 
            Raiden he uses wind in the storyline he is dead finally we have smoked his name gives us 
            the hint he uses smoke what else would he use if that was his name. This game has existed 
            for quite some time and is 29 years old.

            
            There are many versions of this game. There also is a storyline and a story mode. 
            
            Overall, I give this game a Solid 7 out of 10.

        <h2> AMONG US </h2>
        <p>
            Among us is a 2D game. There is crewmates and one imposter. There are various 
            types of maps one is the Airship, Skeld, polus, Miha HQ. There can be two imposters 
            and 3. You basically must vote the imposter of the ship or complete all the task to win.
            Whereas the imposter must kill everyone to win. You can change skins before the match 
            starts and your characters skin Colour. You can also host games and choose how many imposters 
            there should be the type of maps and the characters speed and vision. This game can glitch,
            but it is quite rare. 

            Overall, I give It a SOLID 7/10.

        <h2> CALL OF DUTY ADVANCED WARFARE </h2>
        <p>
            This is one of the many calls of duty games. This game has a story mode and a 
            zombie mode as well. In the story mode you must defeat a group called Atlas after 
            you realised, they used you. You join a different and far weaker group to defeat 
            after endless number of missions you get to a point where you get captured with your 
            comrades after that you break out and realise another of your comrades did not manage
            to survive and died because of loss of blood. Almost the entire group was ambushed, and 
            you were one of the remaining few who had to save the world from Atlas. You find two 
            machines with weapons on it and enter an atlas hideout. Your goal is to stop the 
            bombardment but are a bit late. After that you encounter their leader and kill him.
            There is a load of things I did not tell you so far because I do not want to completely 
            spoil the game. 

            Personally, my favourite one is where we escape the prison it was fun 
            and hard to complete that one. Plus, it was very interesting and cool you get to do all sort of things.
 
            Overall, I give a SOLID 9/10.

        <h2> RESIDENT EVIL 7 BIO-HAZARD </h2>
        <p>
            This is a horror game and is probably for people who are 18+. 
            This game is very graphic the amount of time you lose a hand or leg is so much.
            So basically, your wife went missing 3 years ago and you got a suspicious email about her,
            so you go look for her where the location in the email was given. When you arrive, 
            you find your wife in a cell of some sort and break her out of there after that she 
            tries to lead you somewhere safe but cannot remember where the exit was. Whilst you go 
            looking for an exit you hear screams of her disappearing into the distance. After some 
            time, you find her, but she is possessed by something she gives you the beating but knocks
            herself out she wakes up and this time she cuts your arm clean off you run away and manage 
            to survive Somehow and she comes again but this time you have a gun and shoot her until you think
            she is dead. Then we get introduced to jack, Marguerite, and Lucas. You keep on running and 
            find loot on your way and someone who guides you called Zoe’s baker. 
            You keep on thinking you killed Jack, but he just comes back again and again. 
            You also permanently kill Marguerite. Soon after you meet Lucas who captured your wife and
            Zoe his own sister. He makes you play his games to get a serum of some sort and save both 
            Zoe and Mia. When you are about to save them, jack comes back in his final form and you have 
            a boss battle with him but whilst fighting you use one of the serums left that cures the viruses 
            that are inside of the bakers. You get a choice to leave one of them or take one of them. After
            that Eveline, the person behind this mess captures Ethan and you switch characters to Mia. 
            Mia saves you and you leave the facility without her after you defeat the final boss and save Mia.
            There are 4 boss battles two of them are JACKS. One of them is MARGURITES AND LAST ONE IS EVELINES.

            Overall, I give it a SOLID 10/10.

        <h2> C-OPS </h2>
        <p>
        c-ops are a Game where you have three game modes deathmatch, defuse and gun game. 
        You can customize your skin and weaponry you can play with your friends and family.
        Gun game is where you basically must kill to improve your weapons or at least change 
        them, you must kill 15 people to win. Death match is a game mode where you have two teams 
        and you have a specific timer, where the team with the most kills wins. Defuse is where you
        have two teams and two rounds. One of the rounds you will be defusing bomb that the
        enemy places and in the second you will be placing the bombs. You get two buy items 
        to kill the enemy team.

         Overall, I give it a SOLID 6/10.

        <h2> BRAWL HALLA </h2>
        <p> 
            Brawl halla is a game that you can play with your friends and family.
            You need to try to be the last one standing. However, rather than it being a 
            traditional fighting game, one like Street Fighter, you need to knock your
            opponent off the stage in order to win. Personally, my favourite characters are 
            Magyar, Kor and Sir Roland. Magyar has two weapons like all the characters,
            His weapons are a Sword and a spear that has a spiked ball mounted on it.
            Kor’s weapons are his rock-hard fists and a hammer like thing …. Not sure. 
            Sir Roland’s weapons are a spear that has an engine at the back of it and
            you can ride it and a Sword/Dagger. You can make a private room and tell 
            your friends to join that room by giving them a code. After every round you 
            play you get gold that you can buy skins with. There is also a battle pass and a store.

            OVERALL, I GIVE IT A SOLID 7/10.

        <h2> RESIDENT EVIL 8 </h2>
        <p>
            Resident evil boy oh boy another great resident game. So lemme give you a 
            “quick summary” basically everything going amazing. Mia and you have a child
            called Rose until suddenly boom your “Wife” dies because of a barrage of bullets.
            You get behind the table until Chris shows up, he captures you and your baby, 
            but you wake up unconscious next to a dead man you find your way into a village 
            where you collect resources. After encountering many Lycans you meet their boss 
            that IS HUGGGEE but kindly spares you for some stupid reason. You enter the 
            castle in the village but then you get caught by someone called Heisenberg who can control metal. 
            You wake up next to a tall lady, Heisenberg, big ugly fish, a doll and their boss 
            Miranda. You are chased down but fall into this room where there is a rolling machine
            with spikes on it you find a place to hide and escape. You then visit the Castle Dimitercasu
            which is the tall ladies name just for your kind information. After killing all the 
            daughters of Dimitercasu and some other enemies you arrive and find a dagger as soon 
            as you pick it up Dimitercasu shows up. You hit her with the dagger and then she turns 
            into her true form after and endless battle you defeat her once and for all. 
            You leave the castle and show Duke A trader a flask he then tells you that you 
            are holding your baby and said you must collect all 4 flasks to get rose back. 
            You now fight the doll maker this is the creepiest one out of them all. So, 
            you are exploring the place until you meet a doll with rose’s flask as you grab 
            it the room goes dark and booom your loot gets stolen. Your left with a Big doll 
            and nothing else … really. After finding a well you begin to get chased by a weird
            creature that makes baby noises eventually you find the elevator and escape. 
            You enter the main house where you meet the main doll. After killing her you leave now
            it is time to meet the second ugliest creature according to me you find him vomiting a
            nd there was another rose flask there you take but then he turns around to see you taking 
            it from you he pleads no to take it, but you give a blunt rejection. He traps you but you 
            escape. You get caught by Chris and he tells you to stop but you get interrupted by Moreau 
            the ugly fish. You both disappear and do not see each other. You fight the fish and defeat
            him. Now your second to last boss fight. Heisenberg, he gave you a choice to join him, 
            but you rejected him. You fight him in a machine that Chris tells you to use.  
            After defeating him Miranda shows up and has a mini fight with you. After quite a while you 
            finally defeat Miranda get your baby back but in this process you die Sadly.
            This is not even a proper summary but you know I don’t wanna spoil everything plus it can get boring sometimes.

            Overall, I give it a SOLID 10.

        <h2> BRAWL STARS </h2>
        <p>
            Brawl Stars is a fun 2D type game. Like many other games it has
             a battle pass, and you can use tokens, coin and gems to buy things. 
             You can buy skins for characters you own. You get skins in crates every now 
             and then you will get a skin from a crate.  You can play Duos or solo. 
             But the lobby fits up to 4 people meaning you can be in the same match, 
             but it will be duos. You can play a game where the team with the most gems 
             wins or a football game mode. There is also one where you must collect as 
             many screws as possible so you can make a boss to defeat the other team whilst
             they and your team will protect the generator, if you lose it you lose.
            
             Overall, I give it a SOLID 5/10.
